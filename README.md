This is a very long term proprietary project that began in 2005.

Representing written English in a form that is semantically meaningful yet computationally tractable. This project uses several resources, techniques, and tools. The value of this product is immense, therefore it is not shown in the open. If you would like a presentation, please add me as a connection on LinkedIn so that I can reach out to you offline.
